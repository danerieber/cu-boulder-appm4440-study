# 1.1 THE COMPLETENESS AXIOM AND SOME OF ITS CONSEQUENCES

## Definition: Inductive

A set $S$ of real numbers is said to be *inductive* provided that

**i.** the number 1 is in $S$\
**ii.** if the number $x$ is in $S$, the number $x+1$ is also in $S$.

## Principle of Mathematical Induction

For each natural number $n$, let $S(n)$ be some mathematical assertion. Suppose that $S(1)$ is true. Also suppose that whenever $k$ is a natural number such that $S(k)$ is true, then $S(k+1)$ is also true. Then $S(n)$ is true for every natural number $n$.
